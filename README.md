# BinBud IOS

BinBud is an App that can help users understand where to correctly throw away their trash. The app was inspired from my previous hackathon victory where we coded a VGG16 image classification model on trash from out own custom dataset.

The demonstation to this app can be found here: [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qliQuLgm4fU) 

The project was made using Swift and its various libraries such as SwiftUI, AVFoundation and UIKit. I also converted a the VGG16 model from a keras file to a coremlpackage.  

The app can also now be downloaded in the AppStore! it can be found [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/binbud/id6702029260) or in the about section of this repository post.
