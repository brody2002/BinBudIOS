# BinBud IOS

BinBud is an App that can help users understand where to correctly throw away their trash. The app was inspired from my previous hackathon victory where we coded a VGG16 image classification model on trash from out own custom dataset.

The project was made using Swift and its various libraries such as SwiftUI, AVFoundation and UIKit. I also converted a the VGG16 model from a keras file to a coremlpackage.
